# 🧩 Project Synopsis

## **Data Transformation Framework (DTF) – “The Monster Manual”**

**Author:** **Geoffrey Jones**

* **Duration:** ~4 months (design, build, documentation)
* **Tech Stack:** Zoho Catalyst (serverless functions), Zoho RPA, Node.js, PowerShell, AWS S3, OneDrive
* **Core Skills:** Automation design, data transformation, system orchestration, error recovery, and process resilience

---

### **Project Overview**

The **Data Transformation Framework (DTF)** is a modular automation platform that ingests, normalises and transforms data from multiple sources — including CSV, Excel and PDF files. It bridges cloud and desktop environments using Zoho Catalyst Functions, Node.js parsing logic and PowerShell orchestration.

Originally built to streamline payroll data processing, DTF evolved into a general-purpose, fault-tolerant automation framework capable of scaling across multiple workflows and industries.

### **Key Achievements**

- Built a **hybrid automation framework** combining Zoho Catalyst, PowerShell and Node.js for seamless end-to-end orchestration.
- Developed a **PDF parsing engine** (“PDF Pool”) to interpret inconsistent layouts and extract structured pay data.
- Designed a **multi-stage file pipeline** from local ingestion and validation through to cloud-based transformation and formatted CSV/XLSX export.
- Implemented **robust monitoring and recovery logic**, including watchdog scripts, alerting and holding zones to prevent data loss.
- Authored a detailed companion document — *“The Monster Manual”* — explaining system architecture, logic and future scalability in a clear, narrative style.

### **Technical Highlights**

- **Catalyst Functions:** Secure cloud-hosted data transformations and API integrations.
- **Node.js Modules:** Intelligent text parsing and flexible data mapping.
- **PowerShell Scripts:** File orchestration, task scheduling and watchdog automation.
- **AWS S3 Integration:** Replaces shared drives, ensuring file integrity and scalability.
- **Zoho RPA Flows:** Provide live/maintenance mode switching for safe, controlled updates.

### **Impact**

DTF eliminated redundant manual steps, improved data reliability and made the automation pipeline transparent and maintainable.
Its modular architecture is adaptable beyond payroll — ideal for any environment involving **structured data conversion, batch file processing or system integration**.
